# Financial Chatbot Prototype

## Functionality
This is a rule-based chatbot that answers 5 predefined financial questions:
1. What is the total revenue?
2. How has net income changed over the last year?
3. What is the gross margin?
4. What are operating expenses?
5. What is cash on hand?

If any other query is asked, the chatbot returns a fallback message.

## How to Run
- Open Jupyter Notebook and run `financial_chatbot.ipynb`
- Or export the notebook to `financial_chatbot.py` and run with `python financial_chatbot.py`

## Limitations
- Only works with exact predefined queries.
- No natural language processing.
- Uses static sample CSV data, not real-time feeds.
